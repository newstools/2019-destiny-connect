Music promoter, events co-ordinator, brand strategist and yogi – Tseki is the ultimate multi-tasker. At an age when many people are still trying to find their niche, she has a string of successful ventures to her name and is the person others turn to when they want to build or strengthen their brands. To date, Kool Out Concepts – the events business company she established with two partners – is probably the most visible of her initiatives. It operates from a rooftop venue in the Johannesburg city centre, where Tseki and her partners rent out office space and host events. Together, they also organise international concerts and festivals under the Alchemy brand name.
