Artist manager and PR guru Afari believes in building sustainable brands, rather than flash-in-the-pan sensations. And, with over 10 years’ experience in the entertainment industry her passion for creating brands with longevity has seen her partner with some of the most celebrated names in South African showbiz. “My introduction to this industry was in varsity, when some of my friends, who were musicians and DJs, asked me to manage them. At the time, I didn’t think much of it and went into it blindly.” Yet even in those days, as an inexperienced artist manager, professionalism and artists’ interests always came first for Afari, who ensured that they were well taken care of and paid for performances, even if the events weren’t successful.
