Team SA faces a series of key engagements on Wednesday, including bilateral meetings, a press conference before a global media and a Country Strategy Dialogue on South Africa. Ramaphosa arrived in Davos late on Tuesday afternoon and immediately met with the likes of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and other members of the economic cluster, as well as International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko said the message that the country is bringing to WEF is that South Africa is on “a path of renewal and a path of growth”. “Remember when we came here last year there was a lot of uncertainty back home in terms of, firstly, just our leadership, in terms of the challenges we were facing in our State-owned enterprises and general governance,” Diko said.
