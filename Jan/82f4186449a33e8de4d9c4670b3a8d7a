Property agent Seeff reveals that on a budget of between just under R300 000 – R1,5 million, purchasers can buy into a secure lifestyle and established neighbourhoods, close to major highways and roads, good schools and great amenities. Affordability is also a significant factor, with many first-time buyers looking to purchase off-plan, as there are transfer duty savings and the advantage of being in a newly-built unit. However, the space and value for money offered by slightly older units are also very attractive to first-time buyers, provided they don’t mind fixing their properties up a little over time. WESTERN CAPE Two-bedroomed apartments in Goodwood start at R550 000, three-bedroomed apartments start at R900 000 and houses in this area start at R1,2 million. Richwood, Bothasig and Burgundy Estate all offer easy access to the N7 and N1 and are close to Table View, Milnerton, Blouberg and Century City, making them desirable options for budget-conscious buyers.
