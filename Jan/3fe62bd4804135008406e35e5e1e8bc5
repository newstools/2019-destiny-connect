London-born Rebecca Fuller-Campbell has always loved Africa and is thrilled to finally call the continent her home of Africa. Since immigrating to SA, she’s not only raised children and built a media powerhouse, but has indulged her lifelong passion for story-telling. “I’ve been living in this country for 10 years and love it intensely. The entrepreneurial opportunities and possibilities here are very exciting,” she says. After first arriving on our shores, she worked as a Development Producer for Ochre Media, but – while she enjoyed her job – she realised that she needed to venture out on her own. “I’m not a very good employee. I don’t like the confines of being told I can’t do something. Why shouldn’t I be allowed to?” she says. In late 2015, she decided to join forces with long-time friend and colleague Cremer Van Dango in forming Oxyg3n Media. The name expresses their philosophy, which is to “just breathe – especially when it comes to managing a business”.
