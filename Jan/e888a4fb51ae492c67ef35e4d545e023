A statement from the South African government delegation in Davos painted SA as “the most developed, diversified, technologically advanced and industrially integrated economy on the African continent”. President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead a strong team to the 2019 WEF annual meeting as South Africa aims to ramp up international investment. At a pre-WEF breakfast in Johannesburg last week, Ramaphosa said WEF would allow South Africa to build on the success of the President’s Investment Conference in October 2018, where R290 billion was raised for future investments. “We are going to Davos to interact with potential investors,” Ramaphosa said. “We are competing with other emerging markets where there is an oasis of investment opportunities for global investors and it’s where we want to be seen to be investing.” Team South Africa will be selling the country as a preferred investment destination in Africa and also an important gateway for markets and other business opportunities throughout the continent.
