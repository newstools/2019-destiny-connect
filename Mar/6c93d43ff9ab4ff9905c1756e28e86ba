Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebre-Mariam says that both the captain and the first officer of the ill-fated Flight ET302, which crashed near the town of Bishoftu 62km south-east of the capital Addis Ababa on Sunday morning killing all 157 people on board, were experienced pilots. The East African reports that Tewolde said Captain Yared Getachew, an Ethiopian-born Kenyan national, was the senior pilot, who had been flying the same plane since November 2007. His first officer, Ahmednur Mohamednur, had several flight hours under his belt. The Boeing 737 Max-plane, which underwent a routine maintenance check on 4 February, was flying from Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport to Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport when it crashed.
