Bonang is known for her love of bubbles, so when news broke on Monday that the media personality has launched her very own range of Brut and Rosé Methode Cap Classique (MCC) called House of BNG, it seemed to be a perfect fit. “The House of BNG has been a passion project of mine for a very long time. It’s no secret that champagne is my favourite drink, so creating my own MCC was an opportunity I could not miss out on,” Matheba says. “I made the choice to create an MCC with Cape Grapes rather than a champagne made from region-specific French grapes.”
