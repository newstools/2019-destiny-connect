The ANC in Gauteng says Sports MEC Faith Mazibuko will be hauled before the party’s integrity commission after her recorded meltdown and threats to her two executive managers. ANC provincial Secretary Jacob Khawe said the governing party leaders met with Mazibuko and were disappointed at her conduct. ”We want to once more apologise to the Indian and white communities and state that the ANC is a non-sexist, non-racial organisation. We will bring MEC Mazibuko before the integrity committee for due processes of the ANC,” said Khawe. Meanwhile, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has called for Mazibuko’s dismissal, saying it was “deeply perturbed” by the racialised and sexist nature of Mazibuko’s attack on the officials. The Head of Department (HOD) and CFO, a white woman and Indian woman respectively, were chastised and sworn at by Mazibuko after they told her that community sports facilities, referred to as “combi courts”, would not be ready ahead of the 8 May general elections. In the audio recording of the meeting that has since gone viral, Mazibuko is heard telling staffers that she wants the combi courts or their resignation letters. She further tells them they should thank her for their positions in the department since there were no white and Indian top officials in provincial governments.
