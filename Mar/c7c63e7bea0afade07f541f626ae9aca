The department in a statement said it has so far on Thursday issued nine precautionary suspension letters, of which seven are against Black Business Supplier Development Programme (BBSDP) and two against Co-operative Incentive Scheme officials (CIS). “The people of South Africa deserve a professional service dispersed equitably without fear or favour. Access to finance remains a critical challenge for SMMEs and cooperatives and so, we had to act decisively on this matter in order to prevent the possible perpetuation of corruption and further prejudice to SMMEs and cooperatives,” Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said. The department in August 2017 conducted an investigation into incentive schemes CIS and BBSDP, following the indicators of fraud identified through the Auditor General of South Africa (A-G) 2016/17 regulatory audit, the Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development Oversight visits and observations.
