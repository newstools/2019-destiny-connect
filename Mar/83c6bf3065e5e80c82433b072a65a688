The handover – part of  Human Rights Day celebrations – was conducted by the province’s Human Settlements MEC, Babalo Madikizela, at Tambo Village. The homes were built by the Ciskei homeland government in the 1980s. Madikizela said the deeds “restored the dignity” of the beneficiaries and gave them the right to own the houses they had called home for the past three decades. “We have decided to celebrate and honour all those who died years ago on this day by serving this country. We have come to make sure that members of this community get to enjoy the right of owning where they live,” said Madikizela. The human settlements department and Enoch Mgijima Municipality undertook a verification process to ensure the deeds were handed to the rightful beneficiaries.
