The SAPS made good on a promise made earlier in the day on Tuesday by National Commissioner General Khehla Sitole that Maphumulo would be apprehended before the end of the day. “The suspect in the Babes Wodumo assault case has been arrested and is currently in police custody. He will be processed and taken to court soon,” national police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. He is expected to make an appearance in the Pinetown Regional Court on Tuesday afternoon.
