Much research has been conducted into the link between the age at which a girl gets her first period and a number of associated health risks. Researchers have found that the younger a girl was when she began menstruating, the higher the risk the that she will suffer from a number of allergies and diseases later in life. Here are five things your first period might reveal about your future health risks: Scientists say that women who first started their period either super early (before the age of 10) or those who got their period much later (after the age of 17) had a 27% increased risk of heart disease, 20% increased risk of high blood pressure and 16% increased risk for a stroke, compared with women who first got their period at the age of 13.
