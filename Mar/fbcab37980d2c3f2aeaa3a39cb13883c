As we celebrate International Women’s Day, we have the chance to pause and celebrate the trailblazers of women’s rights and recognise how far women have come over the past 100 years. Let’s be honest, one day each year just isn’t enough. As business leaders, it’s our duty to empower the women in our companies year-round. Here are two ways that enterprises can help to advance gender equity in their workplace: Women (and men) advance faster, perform better and choose to stay with their companies longer when they have effective mentors. Mentors catalyse both professional and personal development. To help mitigate any gender bias, put in place a formalised mentorship programme. Every manager should take on a mentee, and record progress and development throughout the year.
