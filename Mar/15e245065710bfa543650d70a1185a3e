A mangled love seat has been named South Africa’s most beautiful object in 2019 at Design Indaba, the annual conference for the creative industries, in Cape Town. Called Interdependence II, the bright blue curvy bench is a distinctive take on a love seat. “The colour,” said the Design Indaba, “invites the viewer to reflect on the piece as a flowing object, which is not something one would expect from a bench that would traditionally be perceived as motionless.” The bench was nominated by Nandi Dlepu, founder of creative studio Mamakashaka. “The manufacturing ability exhibited with this product is applause-worthy, I really love that it’s an abstraction of something familiar,” Dlepu said. “A shakers-style love seat with a twist, literally.”
