Hair Me Out offers both a wig rental option and an opportunity to buy one. Social media manager Delicia Kasenge (29) and market research analyst Zandile Baloyi (25) created the business in June 2018. “We found that for magazine shoots and trendy events/shows, people would ask to hire our wigs for a night or two because it worked with a certain look they were going for,” they said. When they did further research, they found people had an interest in wigs for short-term periods. “We then started buying different kinds of wigs that we thought consumers would like and from this, decided to formalise it as the business offering we now call Hair Me Out.” HAIRMEOUT  Wig sale & Wig rentals#Bewhoyouwanttobe #HairMeOutZa #GirlzTalkZa  pic.twitter.com/uiNDPqOh7q — Hair.Me.Out (@HairMeOut_ZA) July 19, 2018  Humble beginnings Starting with self-funded modest capital base of R25 000, the duo now has 20 wigs, and counting.
