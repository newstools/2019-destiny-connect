Speaking during a media briefing introducing the new Commissioner of SA Revenue Services, Edward Kieswetter, Mboweni said the user-pay principle is a culture that has to permeate South African society “It is within that context that I am very not happy with the decision by the Sanral board not to pursue those who have been defaulting on the e-tolls,” Mboweni said. “It’s a very bad decision, they should never have taken that decision, it is not helpful in the bond market, it is undermining what we have said in the Budget that we support the user-must-pay principle, and they must reverse that decision immediately, or else this has implications for the bond market, the fiscus and their own credit rating. “People must learn that you don’t take careless decisions in the middle of a very difficult financial situation. So pay your taxes, render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar.”
