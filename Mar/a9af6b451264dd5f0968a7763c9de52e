Coconut oil has a thousand and one benefits. It’s one of the few products one can use in the mouth and on skin and hair. One of its many functions is as a mouthwash of sorts. Swirling about 15ml (a tablespoon) of coconut oil around in your mouth for about 15 minutes will extract most bacteria stuck in the mouth. It also acts as a lubricant for the teeth, preventing stains from sticking, which hinders plaque from forming and causing cavities. This is a traditional Indian method of whitening your teeth.
