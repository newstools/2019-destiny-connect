At a media briefing in central Durban on Tuesday, Reverend Welcome Simelane and his wife Thokozile read a short prepared statement and declined to take any questions afterwards. Bongekile was set to attend the briefing, but did not do so because she was getting medical attention, said the reverend. Late on Sunday evening, Wodumo broadcast live via her Instagram account from inside her bedroom, where a man believed to be her boyfriend, Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo, walked into camera shot and struck her several times during what appeared to be an argument.
