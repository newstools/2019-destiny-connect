Women who deliver outside of a hospital setting are at a near three times greater risk of suffering from birth-related complications and delivering a stillborn baby. This is according to new research from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Soroka University Medical Centre in Israel, which compared the data of 3 580 women who gave birth at home against around 240 000 women who gave birth at Soroka over a period of 23 years from 1991-2014.
