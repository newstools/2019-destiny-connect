“Following a weeklong fuss over a miracle that happened at Alleluia Ministries International under the hospice of Pastor Alph Lukau, Cosa was shocked to learn that jealous populist such as Prophet Mboro are now pressing charges against Prophet Lukau, instead of following our basic biblical principles of inviting Dr Alph Lukau into a meeting,” said Cosa President, Pastor Derick Mosoana. He said Mboro’s “desperate attempt to remain relevant have an aftertaste of Afrophobia”. Mosoana went further, recalling the December 2017 furore over the death of three-year-old baby Latoya, after Mboro had prayed for her at his Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni.
