Speaking to The Juice, the star said that construction on the “Linags Resort” is currently underway. “They’re busy with swimming pools as we speak. Later on, we will build accommodation. We’ll do that in winter when no-one is coming to swim.” Dr Malinga says the idea to have his very own resort is one that he has had for a long time. According to him, there are two under construction, both of which will be opening in 2019.
