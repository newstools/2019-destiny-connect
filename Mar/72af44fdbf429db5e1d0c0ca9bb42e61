Social media giant Facebook has announced that it will partner with Cell C to launch its Express Wi-Fi service in South Africa. “With Express Wi-Fi, Facebook works with Internet providers and mobile operators to help build and grow their Wi-Fi businesses in a sustainable and scalable way,” the company said. In other words, people can buy vouchers from a small business owner to access and use Facebook Express Wi-Fi via a hotspot.
