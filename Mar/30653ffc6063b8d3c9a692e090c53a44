Blended families, says the South African College of Applied Psychology (SACAP), can be unchartered territory for children and parents alike. Gone are the days when families were primarily a nuclear unit – a couple with their children. Today, blended families – or step-families as they were previously called – are on the rise. They are formed when divorced families come together to form a new familial unit. This is no surprise at a time when divorce rates in SA are also showing an upward trend. The Marriages and Divorces report released by Statistics South Africa in 2018 shows that divorces increased year-on-year, with most marriages lasting only five to nine years. “In 2016, 55% [of] divorce cases involved children aged less than 18 years.” Naturally, navigating so many personalities while recovering from divorce can be a minefield for anyone.
