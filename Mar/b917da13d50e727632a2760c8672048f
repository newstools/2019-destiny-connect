The Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals (ABSIP) said on Monday Absa’s appointment of black executives in the corporate and investment banking division showed the bank now recognised the importance of transformation and ethnic diversity. Last November, ABSIP expressed concern at the bank’s appointment of two white men as new CEO of Corporate and Investment Banking and Chief Executive for Engineering Service, saying this made the top echelons of the bank’s investment banking too white and too male.
