Afrikaner rights organisation AfriForum should unconditionally retract a documentary that “soft-soaps” and “sanitises” apartheid, says the Director of the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), Frans Cronje. An AfriForum documentary on land reform seemingly sanitises the motives behind Apartheid and the brutality of its practices; the IRR unreservedly repudiates these sentiments. Take a stand with the IRR at https://t.co/8XlvDn2sjkhttps://t.co/04pisJeqO4 — IRR (@IRR_SouthAfrica) March 12, 2019  The IRR issued a statement on Tuesday slamming AfriForum for a documentary in which apartheid premier Hendrik Verwoerd is venerated as a “philosopher” who attempted to recreate Europe in South Africa. According to the IRR, the documentary, titled Disrupted Land, “seemingly sanitises the motives behind apartheid and the brutality of its practices”. Cronje on Wednesday went further: “In principle, any organisation that drives the right issues deserves support on that issue, although that will be very difficult here now. On this issue, we are utterly at odds. They must unconditionally retract, and more.” Cronje says the IRR has tried to influence AfriForum and to “impart some common sense”. “But I must say on this issue, I think AfriForum are so far off the mark that even that may be tough.”
