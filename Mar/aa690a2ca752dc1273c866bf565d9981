The petrol price will rise by 74c a litre from Wednesday, while the wholesale price of diesel will increase by up to 93c, the energy department said on Monday. South Africa’s fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, based on international oil prices, import costs such as shipping and the rand exchange rate. “The average brent crude oil price increased from $60 to $64 per barrel during the period under review,” the energy department said, citing an agreement by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), other non-Opec producers and Russia to reduce oil supply to global markets by 1,2 million barrels per day.
