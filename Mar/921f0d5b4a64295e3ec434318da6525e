Two 15-year-old suspects believed to be involved in the murder of a Mondeor High School learner were arrested on Thursday morning, police said in a statement. Mathebula, aged 19, was fatally stabbed on Wednesday on his way to school. He was a grade eleven student. “The suspects were arrested in Soweto and Naturena … which brings the total number of arrested suspects to three within 24 hours,” South African Police Services spokesperson Kay Makhubela said. On Wednesday police had revealed a breakthrough with the arrest of the first suspect, a 13-year-old pupil. Makhubela said a team of detectives followed up information from the scene, which led them to another school in Mondeor attended by the 13-year-old suspect.
