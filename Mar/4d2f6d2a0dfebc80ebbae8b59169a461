It’s been 22 years since Mogodi exchanged her classroom for a real estate office. After five years of teaching science and maths to high school pupils, and acquiring two teaching degrees, she decided she could do more with her life and decided to enter the business world. “I loved teaching, but needed something that would challenge me. At that time, my father was in construction and I used to help him with clients. I learnt a lot from him and that’s what inspired me to go into real estate. In helping my father, I also built up my own clientele base, so I was confident about formalising my own business,” she explains. In 1997, with only her teacher’s salary as funding, Mogodi approached family members to assist with more capital for the business. “I rented an office in a little mall in Protea North, Soweto. I bought computers, hired a receptionist and two agents, and we started working. I also registered at Wits Business School and did a post-graduate degree in business administration. I learnt a lot about growing the business and handling challenges caused by the state of the country’s economy. That’s why, when the property market crashed in 2007 and many companies closed down, we managed to hold on,” she says.
