“The Princess was a freedom fighter in her own right. For many years, she was an active member of the Women’s Brigade of Inkatha yeNkululeko yeSizwe and actively took part in its political activities. History recalls that she took part in the ANC’s 1950 Defiance Campaign. The IFP therefore salutes this heroine of our struggle as she exits our stage to join the many heroes and heroines of South Africa’s struggle for liberation. “Princess Irene was instrumental in leading the IFP’s women-driven economic programme of self-help and self-reliance, which encouraged women to participate meaningfully in sustainable agriculture and other economic empowerment initiatives,”  IFP Secretary-General Velenkosini Hlabisa said in a statement. Princess Irene died on Monday after a long illness at home in KwaPhindungene, KwaZulu-Natal. The Buthelezis were married for almost 67 years. Irene leaves behind her husband, their children, Prince Ntuthukoyezwe Zuzifa, Princess Phumzile Nokuphiwa and Princess Sibuyiselwe Angela, and many grandchildren.
