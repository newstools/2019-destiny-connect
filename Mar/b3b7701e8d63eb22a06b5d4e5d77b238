Air pollution is killing more people every year than smoking, according to research published on Tuesday that called for urgent action to stop burning fossil fuels. Researchers in Germany and Cyprus estimated that air pollution caused 8,8 million extra deaths in 2015, almost double the previously estimated 4,5 million. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates smoking kills about seven million people a year globally. The researchers found that in Europe – the key focus of the European Society of Cardiology research – air pollution caused an estimated 790 000 deaths, between 40% and 80% of them from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke.
