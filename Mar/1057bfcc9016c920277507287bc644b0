Divorce is on the rise in the country, probably because marriages take a lot of compromise, time, and commitment. Stats SA’s marriages and divorces statistics for 2017 show that 25 390 completed divorce forms were processed, an increase of 0,3% from the previous year.  What’s more, almost half – four in 10 or 44,6% – of the 25 390 came from marriages that did not reach their 10th anniversary. The findings come from a combination of household sample surveys, administrative data, and population censuses. To make your marriage work, pay attention to these four fundamentals that will contribute positively to any relationship. Trust As a cornerstone of any relationship, trust is the foundation upon which everything else is built. Speaking to DESTINY, relationship expert and life coach Paula Quinsee says people need to trust in the relationship and their partner to always be there for them, and do right by them. “You need to trust that your partner will make the relationship a priority, that he or she will protect it and keep it safe in terms of boundaries and knowing where you stand with each other,” she says.

Consider couple’s therapy if you feel that you are talking past, instead of to, each other.
