Internationally acclaimed DJ, Black Coffee, was one of many who reacted with shock to the murder of Matwetwe lead actor Sibusiso Khwinana at the weekend, expressing his frustration about crime in South Africa. This, as police were still putting the pieces together. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said on Sunday morning they were yet to make an arrest. Officers were still taking statements from people who were around when Khwinana was stabbed to death in Arcadia, Pretoria, around 23:00 on Friday. “According to information that we have, there is only one suspect,” Masondo said.
