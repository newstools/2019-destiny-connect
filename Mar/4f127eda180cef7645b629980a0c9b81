Receiving a counter offer can be one of the most flattering feelings in the world. No one would blame you for assuming that the gesture demonstrates that your boss believes you’re a valuable asset to the team that they couldn’t possibly dream of letting go. But, experts say more often than not this couldn’t be further from the truth, with most recruitment specialists saying that what they’re really doing is buying time for themselves to search for your replacement at their own pace, and this is why you should think twice before accepting an improved offer. “Yes, you’re an asset, but only because it will cost more to replace you than keep you, especially if your resignation has come as a surprise or at a time when your company cannot be without resources. Boosting your salary or promoting you is a means for your HR to keep you within the organisation until you become more disposable,” says HR manager Zafar Modak.
