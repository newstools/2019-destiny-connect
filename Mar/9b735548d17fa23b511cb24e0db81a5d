Pam Golding Properties is investigating reports of a racist incident allegedly involving one of its employees at a shopping complex in Kyalami, Midrand, on Monday. The estate agency’s offices are in the shopping centre. “We are aware of an incident which took place in or around the public parking area outside of working hours, involving one of our employees. “As the matter is still under investigation, the outcome is yet to be determined both internally and in relation to the party who has unlawfully created the inference on social media that Pam Golding Properties is involved in the alleged incident,” Pam Golding told News24 on Tuesday.
