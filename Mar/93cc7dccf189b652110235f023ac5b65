Has the often exorbitant cost of setting up a website held you back from strengthening your business’s online presence? It’s a problem tens of thousands of entrepreneurs face on a daily basis, but a new player in the web hosting game in SA – GoDaddy – is aiming to make securing a domain and building a website for your small business that much easier and affordable. From today, the company has launched a number of solutions that enable entrepreneurs to purchase a domain name – either .co.za or .com – for R10… but there’s a catch. That’s the price for the first year. After year one, the launch price goes back to the normal rate of R290 per month. This is a pricing model applicable to all their products, so make sure you familiarise yourself with how pricing jumps considerably after the first year. What is pretty cool is that you also have the freedom to get unique with your domain, where instead of .co.za, if you’re a coffee shop owner you could opt for .coffee as your domain name, but this will cost you more.
