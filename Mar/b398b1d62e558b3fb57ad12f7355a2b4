Last year, Phiri took time off work to travel. While touring France, she was struck by how fortunate she was to be an educated, black African woman under 40, from an ordinary family, with plenty of work experience, but no need to work at that point in her life. “Don’t get me wrong: sheer luck didn’t bring me to this point,” says the Zambian-born mother of two and qualified chartered accountant. “I worked hard to get here, but I had many angels on my journey, beginning with my parents.” Her moment of truth in France got her thinking about how she could use her resources to be an “angel” for other African women and this set the ball in motion for her journey towards angel investment. It resulted in her founding the Africa Trust Fund (AFT), a gender-lens angel investment fund aimed at investing in female entrepreneurs and their businesses, in December 2018, opening doors to finance and support for them, and giving them business tools as well as access to markets.
