MEC for Education and ANC provincial Deputy Chairperson Panyaza Lesufi said what Mazibuko said to staffers was ”unfortunate.” ”It does not represent government’s stance on how to treat public servants. We believe it is regrettable, the Premier has indicated he will hold a meeting with her. I believe the Premier will able to resolve this before end of business today,” said Lesufi, speaking in Soweto ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s arrival to campaign on Thursday. In the recording that has since gone viral on social media, Mazibuko is heard ranting about service delivery ahead of the May general elections. An angry Mazibuko can be heard shouting at managers to make sure sports facilities, referred to as combi courts, are constructed in specified communities as soon as possible, ignoring legal and tender processes.
