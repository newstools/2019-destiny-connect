The road safety agency said it welcomed the sentence, which was handed down at the Atteridgeville Regional Court in Pretoria. Thabani Nqakula was arrested by members of the National Traffic Police (NTP) in January this year. “He was stopped for driving an un-roadworthy vehicle on a public road. He offered the officers a R200 bribe to avoid receiving a traffic fine. He was arrested immediately and charged with bribery,” said the RTMC. Nqakula was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment or a R3 000 fine. He was further given a three-year sentence, suspended for five years.
