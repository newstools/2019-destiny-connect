The trick to a perfectly executed cat eye lies in the makeup tools you use. “The first thing you need is a great eyeliner,” says makeup artist Renton Wade. “There are plenty of products to choose from out there, so find one that works best for you. As with any application, it’s all about the tools, so make sure you invest in a good brush.” Whether you’re a first-timer or an accomplished pro, always go for a liner with a precision tip, as it helps you to achieve neat and steady lines. Gel liners have the best staying power and they’re usually waterproof. You’ll need a steady hand, but the thin delicate tip allows for the perfect flick. If you aren’t familiar with liquid liners, try a pencil one first to create the shape, then follow with liquid liner on top – not for beginners!
