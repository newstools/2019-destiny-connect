All eyes will be on Judge Mandela Makaula in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday, where he is expected to furnish reasons for his decision to recuse himself from the human trafficking trial involving Nigerian Pastor Timothy Omotoso. The matter will in all likelihood have to start afresh, meaning that a new judge would be appointed to the case and evidence will have to be presented before court again. So far, the court has heard evidence from state witness Cheryl Zondi, who gave an emotionally charged account of allegedly being raped and sexually groomed while she was a member and singer at the Jesus Dominion International Church (JDI).
