In the early hours of Monday morning, Gqom artist Bongekile “Babes Wodumo” Simelane went live on social media app Instagram with graphic visuals of her partner, Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo, launching a physical attack on her. Simelane is seen asking her attacker “Ung’shayelani? Ung’shayelani?” and saying “Ng’zok’bamba uzobona, ung’jwayel’amasimba“, which loosely translates to “Why are you hitting me? Why are you hitting me?” and “I will catch you out, you are disrespecting me”.

Statistics South Africa reports that the rate of murder of females increased drastically by 117% between 2015 and 2016/17.
