When you put single women together in a room and ask them to talk about relationships, you’ll probably know their “type” within minutes. Some of us like buff men oozing with confidence who can sweep us off our feet, while others like timid, scrawny guys. There simply are no rules. While dating men with similar character traits, mannerisms or even looks isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it becomes detrimental when the relationship drains you or when the same type of toxic behaviour is displayed in different relationships. In essence, your dating habits are toxic and could be holding you back from finding true love.
