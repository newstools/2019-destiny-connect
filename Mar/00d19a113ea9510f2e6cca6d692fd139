Many working mothers are still struggling to juggle time at the office and at home. The Family Friendly Working Hours Taskforce in the United Kingdom describes flexitime as:”Part-time working and can include job sharing, flexible hours, compressed hours, term-time working and working from home, or varying start and finish times.” For women, working flexible hours has a number of benefits, these include allowing them to be able to take care of their families, attend their children’s school events and look after their sick children. Janice Hanly, a Johannesburg based Life and Business Coach, says flexible hours have now become necessary. “In cities like Joburg and Cape Town, the traffic has become so crazy that you will spend sometimes two hours or longer  just commuting everyday. Which is really difficult if you’ve got children and so it makes sense to organise it so that you get flexitime… out of traffic hours.”
