It’s one thing to run a business. It’s quite another to grow it to a 62-strong fleet that caters to commuters both locally and as far afield as Zimbabwe, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. That’s exactly what Lucia Netshituni, Director of Netshituni Coaches, has done. The transport business, however, was never something she envisaged entering when she was younger. “I actually wanted a food chain franchise, or any other form of franchising,” she says. “It’s a very different world from what I’m doing today!” Netshituni Coaches was established in 1984 by Netshituni’s husband, Andries, in Venda, with the aim of providing transportation to teachers, nurses and scholars. Tragically, in 2013, Andries was killed in a car crash, which also left Netshituni wheelchair-bound for almost a year. Nevertheless, she overcame her grief and injuries and when the business had 45 buses, she decided to take it over fully.
