The DA said President Cyril Ramaphosa’s delayed train ride on Monday depicts exactly what is wrong with the railway system and the governing party. Ramaphosa experienced first-hand the daily struggles of commuters after being stuck for hours on a train with disgruntled passengers while he was on a campaign trail for the ANC with a few of his fellow party leaders. Ramaphosa and the commuters boarded the train at Mabopane Station in Pretoria before 8am. The train was more than an hour late. “The ANC under Cyril Ramaphosa is the same as the ANC under Zuma – just a different driver of the same broken bus. The promise of a New Dawn is nothing, but empty rhetoric intended to fool voters ahead of the election.” – @MmusiMaimane 10-02-2019#ChangeChooseDay #ChooseDay pic.twitter.com/ADrhr1MvZt — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) March 19, 2019  On the way to Bosman Station, where Ramaphosa later disembarked, the train got stuck twice – at Marabastad and Technikon Rant stations – adding another two hours to the travelling time. Tired of waiting, some of the commuters jumped off the train and walked to their places of work, while the President remained put. Ramaphosa was accompanied by Gauteng Premier David Makhura, while some leaders went to various train stations across Tshwane as part of the election campaign.

In addition, many lose their jobs because of delayed and derailed trains,” said the DA in a statement.
