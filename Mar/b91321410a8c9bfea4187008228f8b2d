Tshifularo on Wednesday led the team in successfully performing a nearly two-hour transplant surgery on their first patient, Thabo Moshiliwa (40), who damaged his middle ear bone in a car accident. The Minister urged donors and development partners, especially the business community, to support the innovation which he described as “South Africa’s scientific breakthrough”. “As the Department of Health, we shall do everything in our power to assist and mobilise resources to make sure that Prof Tshifularo gets all the help he needs,” Motsoaledi said. The groundbreaking surgery was done at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria. The Department of Health said the procedure, which can also be performed on newborns, may be the answer to conductive hearing loss, a middle ear problem caused by congenital birth defects, infection, trauma or metabolic diseases. It uses 3D-printing technology to effectively replace the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, the ossicles – smallest bones in the body – that make up the middle ear.
