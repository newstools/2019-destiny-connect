State-owned utility Eskom, struggling to produce enough electricity to meet demand, has for the past few days implemented 24-hour rotational blackouts, known as load shedding, suppressing up to 4 000MW of demand at a given time to avoid a total collapse of the grid. “With small businesses already dealing with hikes in VAT (value-added tax) and petrol, coupled with decreased consumer spending, load-shedding is a bridge too far, particularly for restaurateurs,” Retail Capital said.
