Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg on the way forward for her after the judge in the rape trial – she testified in – recused himself, Zondi said she will re-testify against Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso, adding that she was not willing to give up. Judge Mandela Makaula officially recused himself on Friday because his wife owned a guesthouse where State witnesses in the case stayed. “I don’t care how many times I have to tell the truth or go through the same process over and over again – I will keep doing it, I will not give up and that is that,” said Zondi. “I have a responsibility to live up to the confidence our people have in me and to keep going.” Zondi said it was extremely difficult and agonising for her before and she was expecting the process to be even worse and more amplified this time.
