There is no denying that businesses are the most vulnerable in the first five years of operation, says career and business coach Amanda Walsh. “In fact, research indicates that almost two-thirds of start-up small and medium enterprises (SMEs) fail within two years due to a lack of planning, finances and vision,” she says. When considering SA’s low start-up success rate, it’s obvious that taking a job at a start-up company is a risk. Due to tight budgetary constraints, start-up companies may not be able to afford perks, increases and bonuses. You may also be required to wear several hats, manage with few resources and, in some cases, work longer hours.
