“We are setting aside R23 billion a year to financially support Eskom during its reconfiguration,” the Minister said. “The support is conditional on an independent chief reorganisation officer (CRO) being jointly appointed by the ministers of finance and public enterprises with the explicit mandate of delivering on the recommendations of the presidential task team. We will make announcements in this regard in the coming weeks.” Mboweni said the restructuring of the company, which Gordhan termed technically insolvent this month, would make for more competition and transparency, as well as a clear and focused funding model.
