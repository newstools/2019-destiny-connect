State power utility Eskom said on Monday it would implement staggered powercuts, a day after enforcing the first load shedding since December 9 as its generating capacity came under renewed pressure. “Eskom will implement Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 09h00 today and is likely to continue until 22:00,” said the struggling utility, which has asked for annual tariff increases about three times the consumer inflation rate over the next three years. “Although a number of generating units have returned to service as per the 9-point recovery plan, regrettably additional units continue to trip. This results in a shortage of generation capacity,” it added.
