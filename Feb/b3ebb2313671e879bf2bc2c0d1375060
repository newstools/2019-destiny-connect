The matter is expected to appear in the motion court before Judge Rashid Vahed of the Durban High Court on Wednesday as item 32. It is unclear whether they will appear in court in person. Rumours of the split first started circulating in September 2018, when Sunday newspaper City Press reported that the couple was no longer living together. It is unclear what has triggered the divorce, but it is widely known that the couple has massive financial problems after the South African Revenue Service (SARS) seized both their personal assets and those of their various companies, under the banner of Zikhulise Group, in November 2016. SARS claimed at the time that they owed the receiver “in excess of R204 million”.
