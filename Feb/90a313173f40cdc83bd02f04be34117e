Garrison Church, which accommodates 100 people and is located at the village opposite the post office on the island, was packed to capacity as the couples’ families and friends joined in the celebrations. Addressing the couples, Minister of Home Affairs Dr Siyabonga Cwele, said: “Indeed, there is nothing better than love. Our beautiful couples could not have chosen a more storied place to cement their love than Robben Island.”
