On Wednesday, Motsoaledi conducted a site visit at the state facility, which has long struggled with the primates invading the hospital’s kitchen. The animals recently invaded the wards and were caught in a video that went viral on social media. “Regrettably, RK Khan is not the only medical facility that is affected by these primates which are also causing problems at Durban’s Prince Mshiyeni Memorial and Wentworth hospitals,” DA KZN spokesperson on health Dr Imran Keeka said in a statement. He said the DA would ask Motsoaledi to extend any interventions to both facilities, adding that the video which went viral had reportedly failed to show an incident where a patient was bitten by a monkey.
