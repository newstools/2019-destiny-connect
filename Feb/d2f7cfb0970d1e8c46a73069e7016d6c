Harbouring repressed emotions can result in insomnia, anxiety and weight-related problems. Kezia Kent, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Association for Dietetics in SA says there are easy habits you can implement to reach your goal weight: 1. Being well hydrated is important for weight loss and overall health, so aim for at least eight glasses of water daily. Add fresh herbs or chopped fruit to make water taste better. Sparkling water and sugar-free herbal teas can also count towards your daily water quota. 2. Eat regularly through the day. Try to eatevery two to three hours by including healthy snacks between main meals, as this will help you maintain a healthy metabolism and reduce the temptation to over-eat later. Your first meal of the day should be within 90 minutes after waking up and you should never skip meals. 3. Plan your week. You don’t have to prepare all your meals in advance, but having the right foods available at work and at home will help you make wise food choices.
