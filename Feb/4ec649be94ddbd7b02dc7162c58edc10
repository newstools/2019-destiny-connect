The final tally is yet to be determined, but by late Monday, Buhari had won seven of 36 states in Africa’s biggest democracy, according to the Premium Times. Uche Secondus, the National Chairman of the PDP, is challenging the preliminary results, saying they do not tally with what his party has collated across the country. “Firstly, I want to categorically state that our collation centres have all original results from every polling unit, in every ward, in every Local Government Area (LGA) in Nigeria, of which the international community is well aware, implying all results currently being announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are incorrect and thus unacceptable to our party and people,” said Secondus.
