Makamo is no stranger to the world, having previously exhibited his work in France, Italy and the UK, but this feat is certain to evaluate his rising star into the next stratosphere. His piece takes centre stage in the themed issue, centred around optimism and guest-edited by celebrated filmmaker Ava Duvernay. While his work is revered by global stars such as Oprah Winfrey, who last year purchased art from him, Makamo says he was initially apprehensive about taking up the assignment when approached by the prolific magazine because it was something he had never done before. “It scared me because, even though I’ve been working for a long time, it felt like a debut,” he was quoted saying in an interview with Time.  The oil painting, entitled Vision of a limitless future, took Makamo around four months to complete. The issue features 34 people in the creative art field who are changing the way that people view the world.
