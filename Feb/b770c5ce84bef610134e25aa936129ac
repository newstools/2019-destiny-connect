Hot off the heels of a public campaign calling for Vodacom customers to boycott the company over a deadlock with “Please Call Me” inventor Nkosana Makate, the giant network operator faces more public scrutiny. This time it’s over its decision to charge customers up to R49 to carry over unused data into a new month. On Monday it emerged that, come 1 March – when new Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa) data regulations come into effect –  Vodacom planned to charge R5 to roll over 100MB of unused data, R12 for 100MB-250MB, R19 for 250MB-500MB, R29 for 500MB-1GB and R49 for over 1GB.
