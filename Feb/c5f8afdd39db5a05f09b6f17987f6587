This relates to a viral video of Lukau, of Alleluia International Ministries church in Kramerville, Sandton, performing a “resurrection”. In the video, a Kings and Queens Real Funeral Services hearse can be seen transporting a coffin into the church, where Lukau and congregants pray before the man rises from the coffin, breathing heavily in what is apparently staged to be a miraculous resurrection. In a media statement titled “This unholy media war must stop now!”, Mboro, together with the South African Funeral Practitioners’ Association (Safpa), voices his displeasure about Lukau pulling “such an antic for the sake of quick fame and cameras”.
