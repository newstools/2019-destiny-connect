Delivering his second state-of-the-nation-address in Parliament, Ramaphosa said government was giving effect to its commitment to build human settlements in well-located areas that bring together economic opportunities and have all the services and amenities that people need. “The Housing Development Agency will construct an additional 500,000 housing units in the next five years, and an amount of R30 billion will be provided to municipalities and provinces to enable them to fulfill their respective mandates,” Ramaphosa said.
