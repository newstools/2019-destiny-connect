When news of the court case broke, many accused multinational giant Beiersdorf – owners of Nivea – of being a bully. But, Johannesburg High Court Judge Denise Fisher didn’t share the general public’s sentiment and has ordered Ferguson to come up with new packaging for her Connie Bodycare Men Shower Gel. Ferguson’s company, Koni Multinational Brands, which was launched in 2012, must now go back to the drawing board and remove all images of the offending packing from websites, social media platforms and signage, TimesLive reports. While Judge Fisher conceded that there were significant differences in packaging, she ultimately ruled that there were also many similarities that could confuse the consumer into buying her product when they actually intended to buy Nivea’s product.
