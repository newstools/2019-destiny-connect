Last week, AGO announced it had filed for voluntary liquidation after two of its banks – FNB and Absa – informed the controversial business they were closing their banking facilities. On Friday, workers were shut out of the firm’s Krugersdorp head office, a day after the High Court appointed a liquidator to wind up the company. At the time, liquidator Cloete Murray said he could not confirm how long the workers would be employed for. On the same day, the South African Revenue Service (Sars) swooped on AGO’s campus, seizing documents and computers.
