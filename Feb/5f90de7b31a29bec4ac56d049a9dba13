PCCW Media is giving it a second try in South Africa. This comes after their failed attempt with the streaming service ONTAPtv in mid-2018. The SABC has signed a 24-month deal with Viu and will remove some of its most popular local shows like Uzalo and Skeem Saam from YouTube. The streaming service will offer a hybrid of both free and paid content has launched in South Africa with the app now downloadable, amid the growing subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) streaming wars. Viu will try to duke it out in a crowded field with the likes of streaming services like Netflix South Africa, MultiChoiceâ€™s DStv Now and Showmax, Amazon Prime Video, Acorn TV, TV2GO and others in the increasing battle for digital eyeballs. The service launched in October 2015 in Hong Kong for the Asian market and has since expanded into other countries and is now available in India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan, besides South Africa.
