The bank said it had detected abnormally high volumes and disputes of such suspicious debit orders in December and January using the bank’s mobile app and online banking, among other channels. After contacting a number of customers to validate the debit order mandates provided by Procall, it found that they had not authorised this. “Our investigations have provided sufficient proof that the impacted customers had not provided a mandate for the debit order and as result, the debits to customer accounts were unauthorised,” FNB Consumer Chief Executive Dr Christoph Nieuwoudt said, adding that the bank was reversing all Procall debit orders and associated charges, as well as those by Mzansi.
