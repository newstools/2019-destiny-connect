The state asset manager confirmed on Tuesday that it was issued a compliance notice on 21 February, which requires it to recover the capital investment made to AYO within 15 business days of the date of the notice, and provide the Commissioner of the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) with confirmation. According to the notice, it must also recover any interest that may have accrued on the investment within six months. The CIPC stated that based on the available turnover figures, the PIC did not act in good faith and in the best of interest of the company when “it decided to invest the disproportionate amount of R4,3 billion in AYO”.
