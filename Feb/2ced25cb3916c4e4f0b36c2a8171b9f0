In this day and age, we shouldn’t be in a position where we have to choose between a job or education and our roots. Black women and men are sometimes denied professional or educational opportunities – such as the learner at Pretoria High School for Girls, who defied her school’s policy on hair by being unapologetic about her black aesthetic. A few women tell us how they would respond if someone told them that their natural hair was unprofessional. HR specialist Hope Lukoto says she would ask: “Do you have an allergic reaction to how I was born?” Depending on who’s” asking, Lukoto says she would have a comeback. “I’d pick on them and say something like, ‘Let’s talk about that lipstick colour’,” she says. No one should force you to wear a weave or relax your hair.
