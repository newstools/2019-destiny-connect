Zwelithini has partnered with JR Capital and an established mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) to create aptly-named Bayede Mobile, a new mobile network the consortium plans to unveil in the second quarter of the year, MyBroadband reports. Financially backed by the public and private sector, Bayede Mobile is expected to be a game-changer, particularly among users in remote and rural areas. Promising to offer affordable rates to improve mobile accessibility and to “help reach those with little to no access to basic mobile infrastructure at an excellent rate”, the network will piggybank off some local networks. “Initially, Bayede Mobile will be strategically positioned to leverage existing infrastructure of some of South Africa’s biggest mobile networks, thereby bringing reliable connectivity, at an affordable flat rate,” JR Capital said in a statement.
