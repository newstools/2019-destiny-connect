What Men Want is the funny gender-swapped remake of What Women Want (2000), which featured a cool Mel Gibson (before his fall from grace) and his newfound ability to hear women’s thoughts. This remake features ever-amazing Empire queen Taraji P Henson as Ali Davis, a workaholic sports agent who’s struggling to be promoted to partner – a rather toxic, boy’s club sports management company. Henson does a great job showing off her comedic chops, which, combined with her vivaciousness and attitude, means she shines!
