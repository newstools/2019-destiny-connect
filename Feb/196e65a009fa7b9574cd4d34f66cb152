You can still win this Valentine’s Day and give your partner a night they won’t forget. And the added bonus? It’s easy on the pocket. First things first: The menu If you have time, cook your partner’s favourite meal and pair it with a nice bottle of wine or Champagne. If you don’t have time to cook from scratch, hit your local supermarket on your way home and pick up a roasted chicken and a side or two, or maybe a pre-made lasagna that you can just pop into the oven. Don’t forget to get some snack options and dessert like chocolate mousse or cake. For your snack options, think picnic food, like mini pita breads and dips, crackers, cheese and grapes for a mini-cheese board and some fruit – choose sexy options that you can feed your partner like chocolate-covered strawberries and you can put some strawberries in your Champagne for a fun twist.
