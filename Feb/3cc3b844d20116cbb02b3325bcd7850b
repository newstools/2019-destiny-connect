Research from last year’s  World Health Organisation World Mental Health Survey indicates that one-third of first year university students have a readily diagnosable mental health condition. And the South African context is equally frightening. Prof Jason Bantjes, from Stellenbosch University, explains that 25% of South African university students have expressed suicide ideation; at least 12% suffer from depression and a further 15% grapple with anxiety. The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) who run the National Toll Free Suicide Crisis Helpline,  take a huge number of calls – as many as  600 crisis  calls a day  from people seeking help – and  a large number of these calls are from teens seeking help for themselves or on behalf of a friend.
