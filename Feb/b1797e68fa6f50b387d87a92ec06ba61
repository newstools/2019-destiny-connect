Enhle Mbali Maphumulo has given us plenty to celebrate by launching a hair collection which she revealed on her Instagram on Valentine’s Day, and we cannot wait to get our hands on some of her gorgeous locks. Posting a video of herself and well-known faces like Blue Mbombo and Kgothi Dithebe donning her wigs, Enhle captioned her surprise Valentine’s gift to us: “Welcome my hair range Labello by Enhle Mbali with my My Enhle dolls. I have been hearing these ladies look like me, so I got them to be my Enhle dolls. So beautiful”.
