Court proceedings were delayed due to the arrest of the sixth suspect. All six teenage boys, aged 15-16, appeared in camera as they are minors. Outside court, people carrying placards and members of various political parties gathered in support of Themaneâ€™s family, calling for justice to take its course against the accused. His family did not attend court proceedings on Thursday as they reportedly wanted to heal before they could face the alleged killers. Themane (27), a local musician, was assaulted and left for dead on Saturday night in the Flora Park suburb.
