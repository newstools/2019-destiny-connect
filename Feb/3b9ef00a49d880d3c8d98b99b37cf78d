The R50 million fund, an entity under the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, was created to help deserving youth who don’t qualify for bank loans, either due to a lack of collateral or credit history, to either kick-start or grow existing business ventures. Acting KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, who launched the fund, explained that the youth were targeted because they’re one of the groups hardest hit by the country’s almost stagnant economy. “A sizeable number of our youth are trapped in unemployment and poverty. It is therefore important that as government we intervene in order to assist young people to navigate through these challenges.” He went on to say that this was also part of the provincial government’s Youth Economic Empowerment Strategy, which is to ensure a shift in thinking – taking the youth from “job seekers” to “job creators”.
