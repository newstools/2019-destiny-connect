Mdoda is set to host a pre-show Red Carpet Special for M-Net, which will broadcast ahead of the delayed broadcast in SA on 25 February. Never one to miss the Oscars, Mdoda says her latest hosting gig is one of the biggest highlights of her career thus far, describing it as a “vision board” moment. “Hosting the red carpet for M-Net for one of the biggest awards shows in the world is an absolute highlight for me,” she said.
